Suggestions for changes to be made

1.) explain that a Python set must be declared like this: emptySet = set()
    a.) a list is made into a set: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/sets-in-python
    b.) a set cannot have duplicates whereas a list can (verify this is true)

2.) Michael recommends this:
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset
    show the use of the method called: ".difference(*others)"

3.) The most important things about set is that it's a collection with no duplicates and no order.

4.) What is a generator

5.) "orderedDict" needs to be capitalized to "OrderedDict" in the 'Collections' section

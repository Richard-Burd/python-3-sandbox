These references were consulted in the making of *Python Illustrated* - a cheat sheet for using the Python programming language:

The cheat sheet is divided into yellow boxes containing a title letting you know what they discuss, along with archetypal use cases that contain overlapping notes & highlighting to pack as much information as possible into a single observable space.&nbsp;  Although they all contain a standardized set of fonts, colors, and graphic arrangements, each of these yellow boxes possess a unique internal geometry and organization; this allows your brain to use the [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci) in associating different Python capabilities with a *location* on the cheat sheet rather than having to memorize specific syntax and usage details.&nbsp;  By having the cheat sheet up on one of your monitors (while coding in Python) you can reduce your [reliance on stack overflow](https://dev.to/moopet/do-you-copy-and-paste-code-from-stack-overflow-47d5) and more easily recall how to do things because your brain eventually learns *where-to-go* in order to recall specifically when and how you *do-that-thing* you wanted to do in Python.&nbsp;  The question & answer superfluidity found in blog posts and forums are removed and replaced with parsimonious examples that allow your brain to quickly *recall* how the stuff works since you last looked at it.&nbsp;  Several of the yellow section boxes reference each other forming a [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) network of sorts.&nbsp;
